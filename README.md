## Project Overview

This repository implements a Custom Apparel Design (CAD) system where users can:

* Select an apparel type (T-shirt, cap, hoodie, etc.)
* Choose from built-in designs or upload their own
* Position and scale designs onto the chosen apparel preview
* Select printing method, either Screen Printing or Embroidery
* Select quantity (via a "Buy Now" popup)
* Place a one-time order which is created automatically on confirmation
* Pay via an integrated payment gateway - Stripe
* Receive order/shipping/activity notifications

The system also provides admin interfaces for managing users, apparels, base prices and order fulfillment.

---

## Key Features

* Visual product designer (drag/scale/place design)
* Upload and manage user designs
* Admin-managed `PricingRules` model for base prices per apparel type
* Additional cost modifiers (print method, color count, custom artwork) applied in code
* `Buy Now` flow that creates an order immediately
* Or `Draft` your creation to modify or place order for later
* Payment gateway integration and webhook handling
* Notifications via email/SMS (e.g., Twilio)
* AI-assisted design generation

## High-level Flowchart

## Data & Pricing Model

* **PricingRules (model)** â€” holds base price per apparel type (editable by admin).
* Additional costs (e.g., print method, number of colors, custom artwork complexity) are calculated in application logic.
* Orders are created when user confirms 'Buy Now' (no manual admin step required to create the order).

## Setup & Run (Dev)

```bash
# create virtual env
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# set up environment variables in .env (DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_KEYS, TWILIO_*, CELERY_BROKER_URL, etc.)

python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
python manage.py create_superuser

# celery (example)
celery -A project_name worker -l info
```

## How the Flow Works (step-by-step)

1. User browses products and selects an apparel type.
2. User opens the designer: either chooses a built-in art or uploads their own image.
3. User places, scales, and positions the art on the product mockup.
4. User selects print method, color choices and other options. Admin `PricingRules` base price is fetched and additional costs applied.
5. User clicks **Buy Now** and selects quantity in the popup. The app auto-creates an `Order` record.
6. User proceeds to checkout and completes payment via integrated gateway.
7. Payment gateway sends a webhook to your server to confirm payment. The webhook updates the order status (paid/failed).
8. On payment confirmation, background tasks send notifications (email/SMS) and the order moves to fulfillment.
9. Admin can manage orders, mark shipments, and update statuses; users can track orders in their dashboard.

## Admin & Background Services

* **Admin Dashboard**: Manage `PricingRules`, users, apparels, view and process orders, configure shipping details.
* **Background Workers**: Use Celery + Redis for sending emails, PDF generation (invoices), and scheduled tasks.
* **Webhook Endpoint**: Securely validate gateway webhooks and reconcile order payment status.
* **Notifications**: Email via configured SMTP service; SMS via Twilio.
